# QOSF Mentorship Programme Screening Task
Hello! 
My name is Mark Cunningham and this is my entry for the screening task for the Quantum Open Source Foundation Mentorship Programme.

I chose to do Task 1, as the optimization/QML nature of it was very interesting to me.
A description of the task can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ow3v8Y4rYBdgxXNxKV9ZUAM4bwL6211U6DWCcByZ4A4/edit]).

I found the task very challenging. I used Qiskit, which I have a fair amount of experience in using, but this is a use case I had never experienced before. It was my first time using Optimizers for Quantum too.

There a few changes I would still like to make to my entry for the task but that would definitely put me over the time limit. I'm quite proud of what I've done!
If you have any questions - give me a shout.

Mark
